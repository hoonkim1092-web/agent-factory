# Project Log

## 2026-02-19 Session

### Conversation Summary
- Confirmed that project-level conversation/context/progress can be tracked in Markdown.
- Confirmed that agents can also follow project-level logging rules.
- Reviewed current agent list (YAML agents and folder-based agents) and skill status.
- Explained how "missing skills" are detected (role/task analysis, fallback keyword rules, declared-vs-file checks).
- Explained what a skill contains in plain terms (purpose, input, action, test, capability tags).
- Agreed to move context/prompt/logging rules into project agent operations.

### Current Agent Snapshot
- YAML agents:
  - `agents/himari.yaml`
  - `agents/lilith.yaml`
  - `agents/saiba_midori.yaml`
  - `agents/tanjiro_logimind_planning_director.yaml`
  - `agents/deadbyte.yaml`
- Folder-based agents:
  - `agents/himari-test-agent-agent/`
  - `agents/stock-analyst-agent/`
  - `agents/test-assistant-agent/`

### Skill Snapshot (Today)
- `deadbyte`: `issue_tracker`
- `himari`: `Library Evaluation`, `Architecture Design`, `Technology Strategy`, `research_assistant`
  - Registry-confirmed: `research_assistant`
- `lilith`: no `skills` field
- `saiba_midori`: `generate_image`, `perform_web_design_review`, `create_design_system`, `user_flow_optimization`, `research_assistant`
  - Registry-confirmed: all listed skills
- `tanjiro_logimind_planning_director`: multiple custom skills + `research_assistant`
  - Registry-confirmed: `research_assistant`
- Folder-based agents (3): `tools/` directories are currently empty

### Agreed Direction
- Manage context/prompt/progress as project agent rules:
  - `AGENTS.md`: operating rules
  - `agents/*.yaml`: role and prompt definitions
  - `PROJECT_LOG.md`: session history

### Next Actions
- Add rule set to `AGENTS.md`:
  - Update `PROJECT_LOG.md` before and after major work
  - Record status and next action at session end
  - Timestamp key decisions
- Optionally add `PROMPT_SCHEMA.md` and `CONTEXT_SCHEMA.md` for fixed input structure.

### Cross-PC Continuation Guide
1. On another PC, pull latest repo changes and open `PROJECT_LOG.md` first.
2. Continue in the same date section with only 4 items:
   - Goal today
   - Changes made
   - Decisions made
   - Next action
3. If agent/skill changed, update related files together:
   - Agent files: `agents/*.yaml`
   - Skill registry: `skills/registry.yaml`

### Timeline
- 16:49 [SYSTEM] Added log command workflow
- 16:53 [SYSTEM] Workspace command added
- 16:59 [AUTO] end-of-session | branch=codex-rebuild-skill-evolution | modified=0, staged=0, untracked=5
- 17:05 [SYSTEM] Shared memory pipeline enabled
- 17:07 [SYSTEM] Built shared memory system (SQLite + migrate-log + memory-first read)
- 17:10 [SUMMARY] Session summary: added per-project workspace context CLI, memory-first read flow, log+memory dual write, and migration from PROJECT_LOG to shared SQLite memory.
- 17:10 [DECISION] Decision: use SQLite shared memory as default backend, keep PROJECT_LOG.md for human-readable audit, and separate context by project_path.
- 17:10 [NEXT] Next action: enforce startup read and end-of-session auto snapshot in AGENTS.md so every agent resumes with latest shared context.
- 17:11 [WORK] Added root AGENTS.md with required startup read, end-of-session auto snapshot, and NEXT logging rules.
- 17:11 [DECISION] Summary policy updated: avoid hard compression; use light summaries with change/why/state/next in 3-6 lines.
- 17:15 [NEXT] User requested branch workflow: save current state and push on a new branch.
